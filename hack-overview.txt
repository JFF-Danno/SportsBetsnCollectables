## Inspiration
A previous Chainlink hackathon video about external adapters. Also a QR code image generator I wrote from way back when they were new.

## What it does
It allows you to have a punt on the winner of the next Formula 1 race. Winning also gives you the opportunity to mint a commemorative NFT collectable card.
The card text is automatically added using an image processing library. 

## How we built it
Prediction markets are created using a solidity smart contract which doubles as an Api consumer using a chainlink external adapter for resolving the market after completion of the race.
Winning a share of the prize also gets you whitelisted for minting on an Erc721 smart contract. There is a standard minting page as well as one using the nftport api.

## Challenges we ran into
Being on the right testnet to develop the external adapter and prediction market and then be able to mint nfts using free minting services on polygon. I created a standard mint page used in the demo and one for nft port.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Managing to operate the external adapter. Creating collectable cards on the fly.

## What we learned
External adapters

## What's next for Fan Focused Sports Prediction Markets with NFTs
More market options, e.g. Pick the podium winners, pick the points earners. More work is required on the nft auto creation process.
